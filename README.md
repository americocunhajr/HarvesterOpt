# HarvesterOpt

HarvesterOpt is a Matlab code to solve an optimization problem to maximize the energy recovered by a bistable piezo-magneto-elastic energy harveste system.

This package include the follwing files:

* CrossEntropyOpt_Example.m.  -- script with an one dimensional optimization with the CE method

* HarvesterOpt_DirectSearch.m -- script with a program to optimize the harveters via direct serach

* HarvesterOpt_CrossEntropy.m -- script with a program to optimize the harveters via CE method

* PiezoMagBeam_PerfFunc.m.    -- function that defines the objetive function

* PiezoMagBeam_Power.m.       -- function to compute the output power

* PiezoMagBeam_RHS.m          -- function that defines the harvester equations

* test01chaos.m               -- function to compute the 0-1 test for chaos

* trandn.m                    -- function to draw samples from truncated distribution

* plot_ce_animation.m         -- function to plot an animation with CE search for the optimum

* graph_contour_pnt.m         -- function to plot a contourmap and a given point

* graph_binarymap.m           -- function to plot a binary contourmap
